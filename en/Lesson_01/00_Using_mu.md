The cool thing about Mu is that you cannot only write your code with it, you can also download the Python code onto the micro:bit. To do so, make sure that on a Windows machine you have the [mbed Windows Serial Driver](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration) installed. Simply follow the installation instructions on that page.

Having downloaded Mu and installed the serial driver, you're good o go to the first lesson that will teach you the traditional program to talk to your device: "Hello, World!"
